"""
Utility to verify that the evaluation manager is yielding the same results
as the Maya DG evaluation.

If resultsPath is set then the graph output and differences are dumped to
files using that path as the base name.  For example:

    resultsPath           = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone
    DG results dump       = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.dg.txt
    DG results image      = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.dg.png
    ${mode} results dump  = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.${mode}.txt
    ${mode} results image = MyDirectory/emCorrecteness_animCone.${mode}.png

If resultsPath is not set then no output is stored, everything is live.

The return value is a list of value pairs indicating number of differences
between the DG evaluation and the EM mode. e.g. if you requested 'ems'
mode then you would get back {'ems' : 0} from a successful comparison.

Legal values for modes are 'ems' and 'emp' with an optional '+XXX' to
indicate that evaluator XXX should be turned on during the test or an
optional '-XXX' to indicate that it should be turned off. Evaluator
states will be returned to their original value afte the test is run.
If an evaluator is not explicitly listed the current state of it will
be used for the test.

e.g. modes=['ems','emp+deformer']  means run the comparison twice, first
against EM Serial mode, the second time against EM Parallel mode with
the 'deformer' evaluator turned on. You can use multiple evaluators if
you wish: modes=['ems+deformer-dynamics'].

For now the images are not compared, only the attribute values.

If fileName is not set then the current scene is analyzed.

Sample usage to run the tests on a single file:

    from maya.debug.emCorrectnessTest import emCorrectnessTest
    serialErrors = emCorrectnessTest(fileName='MyDir/MyFile.ma', resultsPath='MyDir/emCorrectness', modes=['ems'])[1]

Sample usage to run the tests on the current scene in parallel mode with the deformer evaluator and ignore output:

    from maya.debug.emCorrectnessTest import emCorrectnessTest
    parallelErrors = emCorrectnessTest(modes=['emp+deformer'])
