    Iterator to walk all Maya files in or below a specific directory.

            list of filepaths
    
    Note that only .ma and .mb extensions are recognized so if you turn on both
    skipMA and skipMB nothing will be found. The iterator gives the full path of
    each file found relative to the root directory.
    
    Usage:
            Find all Maya files under "root/projects" that aren't temporary files,
            defined as those named temp.ma, temp.mb, or that live in a temp/ subdirectory.
