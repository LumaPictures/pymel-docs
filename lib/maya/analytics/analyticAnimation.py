        Examine the animation in the system and gather some basic statistics
        about it. There are two types of animation to find:
        
                1) Anim curves, which animate in the usual manner
                   Care is taken to make sure either time is either an explicit or
                   implicit input since anim curves could be used for reasons
                   other than animation (e.g. setDrivenKey)
                2) Any other node which has the time node as input
                   Since these are pretty generic we can only take note of how
                   many of these there are, and how many output connections they
                   have.
        
        When 'showDetails' is True then the CSV columns are:
        
                AnimationNode           : Name of node providing animation (e.g. animCurve)
                AnimationNodeType       : Type of node providing animation (e.g. animCurveTL)
                DrivenNode                      : Name of node it animates (e.g. transform1)
                DrivenNodeType          : Type of node being animated (e.g. transform)
                Keyframes                       : Number of keyframes in the AnimationNode
                                                          Count is 0 if the AnimationNode is not an anim curve.
                ReallyAnimated          : 1 if there is an anim curve and it is not flat, else 0
        
        One row is output for every AnimationNode -> DrivenNode connection.
        This can be an M -> N correspondence so this can be spread out over
        multiple rows.
        
        The above rows are skipped when 'showDetails' is False and then in
        either case some summary rows are printed, one per animation node type:
        
                AnimationNode           : # of nodes of type 'AnimationNodeType'
                AnimationNodeType       : Type of node providing animation (e.g. animCurveTL)
                DrivenNode                      : ''
                DrivenNodeType          : ''
                Keyframes                       : Sum of number of keyframes in all nodes of
                                                          that type. Keyframe count is 0 for non-param
                                                          curve nodes.
                ReallyAnimated          : Number of non-flat curves on nodes of the given type
        
        Return True if the analysis succeeded, else False
