Collection of decorators for use with Maya analaytics.
There are three decorators defined here. You should use
all three so that your decorators become easily self-documented.

        @addHelp                        # Print class docs from a method
        @makeAnalytic           # Flag the class as being an analytic

def __removeIndentation(theString, number=1):
    """
    Utility function to remove the leading documentation indentation in a documentation string.
    Presumes that the leading two tabs or 8 spaces are not part of the formatted documentation
    but leaves all other leading spaces. That's why a simple lstrip() couldn't be used.
    
    'number' is the number of indentation levels to remove. An indentation level is presumed
    to be either a single tab or 4 spaces. Normally you'd have number=2 for class methods and
    number=1 for regular methods.
    
    Returns a list of lines so that the caller can indent them the way they want.
