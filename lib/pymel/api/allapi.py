class SafeApiPtr(object):
    """
    A wrapper for api pointers which also contains a reference
    to the MScriptUtil which contains the storage. This helps
    ensure that the 'storage' for the pointer doesn't get
    wiped out before the pointer does. Pass the SafeApiPtr
    around in place of the 'true' pointer - then, when
    the 'true' pointer is needed (ie, immediately
    before feeding it into an api function), 'call'
    the SafeApiPtr object to return the 'true'
    pointer.
    
    Examples

    >>> from pymel.api.allapi import *
    >>> sel = MSelectionList()
    >>> sel.add('perspShape')
    >>> dag = MDagPath()
    >>> sel.getDagPath(0, dag)
